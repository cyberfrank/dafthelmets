### What's this?

This is a repository containing meshes exported from the Snapchat Lens "Daft Punk: Memories Unlocked", which was an official Daft Punk feature containing 3D models of the helmets in May 2023. This is perhaps the first time the exact proportions of the helmets are accessible in a tangible form, which can offer a good reference for replica makers etc.

None of the model files are not legally cleared in any way so please use with care!

### How?
The meshes were extracted using a graphics debugger and custom export tool.
